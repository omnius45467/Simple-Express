## This is just a simple Express Server

### Getting it running

* Your first step is to clone the repo, and then `npm install` the dependencies

* To actually get the server running you will need to type `node index.js` in your terminal

* You should be able to visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser

### Modifying the example

* The key files in this repo are 
    * `index.js` - If you wanted to connect a database start here
    * `routes.js` - If you wanted to add more routes to your server you can add them here
